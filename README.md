# Predict My Grade

Predicting student performance using machine learning

## Overview

This project explores how factors like gender, study time, parental education, and test preparation impact student exam scores. Using a public dataset, we apply data science techniques to build a model that predicts students' performance in Math.

**Skills demonstrated**:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation (Random Forest)  
- Data visualization with Seaborn & Matplotlib
